# Intro

The apps in this repo simulate users in the [transaction system](https://github.com/kiva/protocol-aries/tree/master/implementations/tdc).
Each app is interactive, meaning you will direct their behaviors.  Each app run in a separate process.  The apps interact with their agents which in turn
interact with the TDC.
